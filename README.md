## üìå Overview

Analyzed simulated retail sales data to explore revenue, profit, and cost trends across multiple product categories and months. Built an interactive Excel dashboard using pivot tables and charts to visualize product-level performance and support business planning.

---

## üéØ Objective

Help retail managers identify top-performing products, monitor cost fluctuations, and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability and streamline inventory management.

---

## üìä Key Insights

- Products in the **Snacks** and **Cereal** categories consistently generate higher profit margins compared to other categories.  
- **Top-selling products** by volume are not always the most profitable, suggesting an opportunity to focus on high-margin products instead of high-volume ones.  
- **Cost spikes** are noticeable in certain months (e.g., February and June), indicating potential inefficiencies or seasonal supply chain fluctuations.  
- **Beverages** show relatively high costs but low profit, raising questions about their contribution to overall profitability.

- Investigate and address the cause of periodic cost spikes to reduce operational waste  
- Prioritize profitable products‚Äînot just top sellers‚Äîfor restocking and promotional campaigns
